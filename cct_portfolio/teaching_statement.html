                    <p>Viral videos of children making hilarious speech errors can be found all over the internet. These videos are adorable, captivating, and &mdash; as a developmental psychologist &mdash; educational. I use videos of children in my own research and am lucky enough to be able to use them in my teaching to both capture students’ attention and to demonstrate important topics. (For instance, the above video is a perfect example of a common feature of children’s early language – frozen forms!) <br><br>I am prepared to teach several courses within psychology, including Developmental Psychology (<a href="cct_portfolio/Dailey_PSY103_Syllabus.pdf">sample syllabus here</a>), Language Development, and Research Methods.</p>

<h3>Teaching Experience</h3>
                    <p>I have been a Teaching Assistant for four courses: Developmental Psychology, Social Psychology, Quantitative Research Methods and Statistics for Psychological Science 1, and Child Observation. These courses ranged from large introductory lectures to small upper-level seminars and included both in-person and synchronous online modes of instruction. As a Teaching Assistant, I worked with professors and co-TAs to design exams and exam review materials, lead discussions, grade assignments and exams, hold office hours, and more. In one course, I led laboratory sections, where I led students through structured activities to teach difficult statistical concepts (<a href="cct_portfolio/Sample_lesson_plan.pdf">sample lesson plan linked here</a>) and created an online resource to provide students with answers to their frequently asked questions (<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nssSIed3tXDyKjl8Tf7Zaxrlu-DSYRTehO_CA42tvtE/edit?usp=sharing">linked here</a>). I have also given three guest lectures, including “Childhood” and “Statistics in R.” Below are excerpts from my <a href="cct_portfolio/PSY204L_Course_Evaluations.pdf">course evaluations</a> for Quantitative Research Methods and Statistics for Psychological Science 1.</p>

<ul style="list-style-type:none;">
    <li><i>“Shannon is a really excellent TA! She makes everyone feel welcome and takes all questions seriously and tries to answer thoughtfully.”</i> (<a href="cct_portfolio/PSY204L_Course_Evaluations.pdf">student course evaluations, April 2021</a>)</li>

    <li><i>“Shannon was great... She really tried her best to answer everybody’s questions and if she did not know the answer, she would always send a follow-up email with detailed information. I usually dread joining zoom calls, but I loved joining lab with her.” </i>(<a href="cct_portfolio/PSY204L_Course_Evaluations.pdf">student course evaluations, April 2021</a>)</li>
    
    <li><i>“Shannon is great at explaining concepts and troubleshooting 1:1, and she’s very welcoming and down-to-earth.” </i>(<a href="cct_portfolio/PSY204L_Course_Evaluations.pdf">student mid-semester feedback, March 13, 2021</a>)</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p>I also completed a <a href="https://gradschool.duke.edu/professional-development/programs/certificate-college-teaching">Certificate in College Teaching</a> to further strengthen my teaching skills. This program is dedicated to training academic teaching and includes coursework in best practices and teaching experience and feedback. Completing this certificate has given me formal training in designing courses (<a href="cct_portfolio/Dailey_PSY103_Syllabus.pdf">link to sample syllabus for a course I designed</a>), creating learning objectives, utilizing effective in-class activities, and supporting diverse learners. Through this program, I have cultivated a reflective teaching practice, through giving feedback on peers' teaching and receiving feedback on my own teaching from peer observers (<a href="PSY204L_Peer_Observations.pdf">linked here</a>; excerpt below).</p>

<ul style="list-style-type:none;"><li>
    <i>“I think the instructor did a great job! It was clear that they were well prepared for the class and did a fantastic job of keeping students engaged in the subject. I especially appreciated that students felt comfortable expressing confusion which is evidence that Shannon has created a welcoming and productive learning environment.” </i>(<a href="PSY204L_Peer_Observations.pdf">peer observer, March 8, 2021</a>)
    </li></ul>
                    
                    <p>Additionally, I have worked with many undergraduate students outside the classroom. Mentoring undergraduate research is a gratifying activity, as it allows students to be more creative and actively engage in the research process. I have mentored individual students’ undergraduate research projects, including an honors thesis, and I have trained and managed a large team of undergraduate research assistants.</p>

<h3>Student Learning &amp; Assessment</h3>

<p>I use active learning activities like Think Pair Share in the classroom to engage students in the material and improve students’ understanding and retention of class material. For example, I led a lab section introducing students to new statistical software, which may have been difficult and overwhelming. However, I used demonstrations, group discussions, and scaffolded independent work (<a href="cct_portfolio/Sample_lesson_plan.pdf">lesson plan linked here</a>) and students were able to successfully run simple statistics by the end of the hourlong lesson and share their results with the class.</p>

                    <p>As a teacher, I prioritize making my courses fair and accessible to all students. As a first-generation college student, I understand the importance of creating a level playing field where all students have the chance to succeed. To do so, I must create a safe, supportive learning environment and make expectations clear to all students, including those from diverse backgrounds whose expectations may differ from my own. One way to level the playing field for all students is to set clear expectations, so students know precisely what is needed to succeed. To this end, I have created and graded with rubrics to ensure clear and fair grades (<a href="Sample_rubric.pdf">sample rubric linked here</a>) and to easily give students feedback on the strengths and weaknesses of their work.</p>

                    <p>I use multiple forms of assessment to give students plenty of opportunities to demonstrate their learning (e.g., in-class activities, formal writing assignments, multiple choice exams). I include low and no-stakes opportunities for students to apply what they are learning (e.g., <a href="Sample_blog_assignment.pdf">informal blog posts</a> applying class material to their everyday experiences). I find that students learn more effectively when they are comfortable voicing confusion, questions, and uncertainty, so I encourage students to raise questions or point out topics that are unclear. For example, I periodically give students an “exit ticket” survey at the end of class to assess what students found clear or not during that class session. This feedback allows me to ensure that the entire class is on track with my learning objectives.</p>

<ul style="list-style-type:none;"><li>
    <i>“My TA makes us all feel very comfortable and relaxed in class. I do not feel pressure to have to understand everything perfectly and I appreciate that.” </i>(<a href="cct_portfolio/PSY204L_Course_Evaluations.pdf">student mid-semester feedback, March 11, 2021</a>)	
    </li></ul>

                    <p>I am devoted to using evidence-based practices in my teaching. I plan to read the current research on teaching and learning and attend workshops and conferences to hone my teaching skills further. I am particularly interested in implementing new active learning techniques and forms of student assessment.</p>
