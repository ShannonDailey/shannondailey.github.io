						<h1>Commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusivity</h1>
					</header>
                    
                    <p>Diversity requires representation of all people, including groups who have been historically excluded and are underrepresented, regardless of race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, gender identity, religion, socioeconomic status, immigration status, abilities, language, etc. Diversity is critical at all levels of the scientific endeavor – from faculty researchers, to graduate students, to the community members that participate in our research, to the dissemination of that research to a broad audience. For this reason, I take a multifaceted approach to promoting diversity and inclusion, in my mentorship efforts as well as my research.</p>
<h3>Mentorshop: Supporting diverse students</h3>

                    <p>I was born and raised in a rural farming community in north-central Pennsylvania, in a county that is home to a single stoplight and 6,000 people. As a first-generation, low-income college student at an elite university, I experienced academic struggles, financial difficulties, and culture shock. My background compels me to focus my mentorship efforts towards supporting first-generation, low-income college students. I have served as a mentor in Duke’s First-Generation Low-Income Undergraduate-Graduate Student Mentorship Program, and as a panelist at the 2018 1vyG Conference and the 2019 Duke LIFE Conference. I have also served as a reviewer for Duke’s clinical psychology Virtual Office Hours program, which provides feedback to underrepresented psychology PhD applicants on their application materials. These programs have been incredibly rewarding, as I have been able to offer my help and advice to students who may be struggling. In this way, I hope to foster an environment where first-generation, low-income students can feel included and supported in our university community.</p>
                    
<h3>Research: Centering diverse experiences</h3>
                    <p>Most research on children’s language development is on middle-class, English-learning children in the United States. This limits our understanding of language development to one specific context and does not represent the experience of most humans. Therefore, I aim to center the experiences of underrepresented groups in my own research.</p>
                    
                    <p>My master’s thesis was a meta-analysis investigating differences language input to children across socioeconomic statuses. I found that infants from low-socioeconomic status families hear less speech <i>directed to them</i> in their everyday environments, but not less speech overall, than their higher-socioeconomic status peers do (Dailey &amp; Bergelson, 2021). Some researchers have posited that low-SES parents speak to their children less because they have less knowledge of child development (Suskind et al., 2016). However, there are many other factors at play that likely influence low-SES parents’ parenting behaviors, such as their elevated risk for depression (Stein et al., 2008; Zuckerman &amp; Beardslee, 1987), which may affect mother-infant interactions (Cohn et al., 1990) and maternal child-directed speech (Bettes, 1988). Language research investigating the “word gap” often does not consider these factors, or the broader context of SES effects on families, when analyzing naturalistic parent speech.</p>
                        
                    <p>My postdoctoral work will investigate potential mechanisms underlying this socioeconomic-based difference in children's language experience. I hypothesize that socioeconomic status differences in children’s language experience could be driven, at least in part, by external, structural factors associated with socioeconomic status that impact parental behaviors (Conger &amp; Conger, 2002; Ellwood-Lowe et al., 2019). As a part of a large poverty-relief randomized controlled trial (<a href="https://www.babysfirstyears.com">Baby's First Years</a>), I ask: Do low-income parents’ stress and mental health directly impact their speech to their children? Specifically, I will investigate if low-income mothers’ speech to infants during one-on-one interactions is affected by their mental health. This project will allow us to better understand how growing up below the poverty line affects children’s early language experience, without disparaging low-income parents’ preferences or abilities.</p>
