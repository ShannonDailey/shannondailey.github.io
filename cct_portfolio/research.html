                    <p>I examine children's language input and their developing language skills over time using various behavioral methods. I am interested in how language input varies systematically between children and families (such as by child gender or family socioeconomic status) and how that affects children's language development.</p>
                    
                    <p>For example, some prior studies find that parents talk more to girls than to boys in infancy and toddlerhood (e.g., Cherry &amp; Lewis, 1976). In my dissertation, I investigate gender differences in early language development in a longitudinal study, asking how children's gender may affect their input and their word production. I found that children’s language input was affected by their own language skills, but not their gender: Children, regardless of gender, heard more language when they began talking.</p>

                    <p>Another factor associated with children’s language input is family socioeconomic status. In a recent meta-analysis (Dailey &amp; Bergelson, 2021), I found that infants from low-SES families hear less language in their everyday environments than their higher-SES peers do. However, the mechanisms driving these socioeconomic-based differences in language input remain unclear. I hypothesize SES differences in children’s language experience could be driven, at least in part, by external, structural factors associated with SES that impact parental behaviors. To address this possibility, my postdoctoral research will be part of a longitudinal randomized controlled trial on the effects of poverty reduction on child development. I wil ask if a monthly unconditional cash gift affects children’s language experience, and if parents’ stress and mental health directly impact their speech to their children.</p>

                    <h3>Open science and reproducibility efforts</h3>
                    
                    <p>A broader scientific movement that I engage in with my work is open science. I have a demonstrated commitment to research transparency. I have written public-facing experimental protocols, completed data cleaning and statistical analyses and written manuscripts in R, and shared code and data via <a href="http://github.com/ShannonDailey">GitHub</a> and other data repositories.</p>
                    
                    <p>Moreover, I use <a href="https://www.cos.io/initiatives/prereg">pre-registration</a> for confirmatory research to increase transparency. For my Master's thesis, I wrote a <a href="https://www.cos.io/initiatives/registered-reports">Registered Report</a>. That is, the study was pre-registered and peer-reviewed before the research was conducted (<a href="https://osf.io/veyxu/">all data and scripts are available via OSF)</a>. I also have preregistered multiple studies on AsPredicted and OSF:</p>
