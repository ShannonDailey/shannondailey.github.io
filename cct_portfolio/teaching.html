<h4>Student Feedback:</h4>
"Shannon is a really excellent TA! She makes everyone feel welcome and takes all questions seriously and tries to answer thoughtfully. When something is unclear in class, she sends follow up emails with more information which are really helpful! She goes above and beyond to help everyone understand the material."
<br><br>
"[Shannon] makes us all feel very comfortable and relaxed in class. I do not feel pressure to have to understand everything perfectly and I appreciate that."
<br><br>
"Shannon was great. I loved the different ice breakers at the beginning of class. She really tried her best to answer everybody's questions and if she did not know the answer, she would always send a follow-up email with detailed information. I usually dread joining zoom calls, but I loved joining lab with her."  
<br><br>
"Shannon is great at explaining concepts and troubleshooting 1:1, and she's very welcoming and down-to-earth. "
<br><br>
"Shannon is super engaging and makes lab interesting and exciting. She encourages everyone to participate and has created a really comfortable class environment."
